## Hi, my name is Rafi
Hi, I am Rafii Firdaus, I am a technology enthusiast and I am currently a student majoring in Informatics Engineering at Semen Indonesia International University.

I am always looking for opportunities that allow me to use my interest in technology and AI and also to build relationships while allowing me to explore and learn.

I actively learn outside the curriculum and am excited to participate in small projects. I believe in the value of teamwork and collaboration. With a high passion for learning, I hope to contribute positively in the world of technology.
